My name is Brian Chang. I was born in Gaithersburg, MD.
 I grew up in Sterling, Virginia.
 I went to college at the University of Washington in Seattle from 2009 to 2013.
 I've been a traveling and competing athlete in brazilian jiu-jitsu for 9 years
 since I was 17.
 I've competed and won in tournaments all around the world.
 I've always had a fascination with computers and am excited to learn about
 programming, web development, and especially mobile phone app development.

My favorite movie of the 2000's is Inglourious Basterds.
